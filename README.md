# digital-clock

In this project, I introduce a fully functional digital clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current local time with a visually appealing design, featuring a gradient background and a clean layout. The implementation highlights the dynamic updating of time, ensuring that the displayed hours, minutes, and seconds remain accurate in real-time.
